## Important Notes

- **Raw data files are NOT tracked in Git** (see `.gitignore`)
- Large files (> 10 MB) should be stored externally
- Refer to [`docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`](../docs/DATA_SOURCES.md) for download instructions

## Data Acquisition

To set up the data for this project:

1. Follow instructions in [`docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`](../docs/DATA_SOURCES.md)
2. Download NYC taxi data and place in `raw/`
3. Download restaurant locations and place in `raw/`
4. Run processing scripts in `backend/data_processing/`

## Processed Data

Processed files are generated by the data processing pipeline:

- `dining_zones.geojson` - Restaurant clusters (output of `01_cluster_restaurants.py`)
- `hotspot_arrival_areas.geojson` - Taxi drop-off clusters (output of `02_cluster_taxi_dropoffs.py`)
- `final_hotspot_dining_areas.geojson` - Combined hotspots (output of `03_combine_hotspots.py`)

## File Size Management

If your processed files are too large for Git:

1. Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)
2. Store on cloud storage (Google Drive, S3)
3. Share via team communication channel
4. Commit only summary statistics

## Data Privacy

- No personal information is stored
- NYC taxi data is pre-anonymized
- Follow data usage terms for each source
